Data set source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/henrylin03/metacritic-games-user-reviews-and-metascores/data This project showcases my skills on handlind missing values and duplicates on a video game data set. 
The process begun by checking the data set for missing values and duplicates as well as the shape and head to learn the columns of it. 
The Data contained both duplicates and missing values, for duplicates I confirmed that they exist and removed them. As for missing values, they were filled with the mean of that same column.

Key Findings
The distribution of Metascores is concentrated around the 70-80 range, with a peak around 70. This indicates that most games receive moderately high scores from critics.
The Userscores are more spread out, with a peak around 6.5-7.5. This suggests that user ratings are slightly lower and more varied compared to critic scores.
The mean Metascore is 70.19, and the mean Userscore is 6.74, indicating that critics generally rate games higher than users.
The standard deviation for Metascores is 5.76, while for Userscores it is 0.79, showing that critic scores vary more than user scores.
The minimum Metascore is 8, and the minimum Userscore is 0, indicating some extreme outliers in the data.
Nintendo 64 has the highest average Metascore (74.87), indicating that games on this platform are highly rated by critics.
Dreamcast has the highest average Userscore (7.77), suggesting that users particularly enjoy games on this platform.
Modern platforms like PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X also have high average Metascores (71.08 and 71.53, respectively), showing that newer platforms maintain high critic ratings.
Critics and users generally agree on the quality of games, as platforms with high Metascores also tend to have high Userscores (e.g., Nintendo 64, Dreamcast).
However, there are some discrepancies, such as PlayStation 4 having a relatively high Metascore (70.18) but a lower Userscore (6.52), indicating a potential gap between critic and user opinions.
