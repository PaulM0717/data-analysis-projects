This project showcases my skills on data analysis.
The process begun by checking the data set for missing values and duplicates as well as the shape and head to learn the columns of it.
I did not need to clean the data as it didn't have any missing value or duplicates so I proceeded with the analysis from which I got the following:
## Key Findings
1. **Top Affected Countries**: The US, Brazil, and India had the highest number of confirmed cases.
2. **Strong Correlations**: Confirmed cases are strongly correlated with deaths (0.91) and active cases (0.89).
3. **Trends in Daily Cases**: Multiple waves of infections were observed, with peaks reaching 77,255 new cases in a single day.
4. **Active Cases**: Trends in active cases highlight periods of rapid spread and recovery.
5. **Mortality and Recovery Rates**: These metrics reflect the severity of the pandemic and the effectiveness of healthcare systems.
6. **Regional Impact**: The Americas and Europe were the most affected WHO regions.
